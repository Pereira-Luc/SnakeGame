# SnakeGame
    
* This is a simple snake game. The snake is controlled by the arrow keys. The food is randomly generated. It includes
a map editor and some pre-defined maps.
#

* The game was tested on a Windows 11 using the Java Version 17-18. The Jar file is included in the repository

* The Jar file can be run without any additional libraries.
#

<h2> Compile </h2>

* I compiled the game with IntelliJ IDEA. The following commands were used:
* `mvn clean compile`
* `mvn package`

 
* Or it can also be run from:
* `View >>> Tool Windows >>> Maven >>> clean & package`
